NANOME is a tool used to extract information from the Pipeline. It is often used by scientists to gain a better understanding of various illnesses, such as cancer, 
by extracting specific information from the pipeline. 


NANOME is used with various documentation tools, such as Nextflow. There are various applications that you will need to download, including nextflow.


In this tutorial, we will be looking at how to get started with nanome, including installing programs such as nextflow!



If you are using a mac, you will need to install [Anaconda] (https://www.anaconda.com/) to do the following in this tutorial. If you are on a windows, please install 
[PUTTY] (https://www.putty.org/) or [MobaX] (https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html] as well as [Anaconda]


Installation

On a mac:

Please type the following in your anaconda terminal:

`conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda nextflow`

On a windows:

Please use the PUTTY or MobaX terminal that you downloaded and type this command:

`wget -qO- https://get.nextflow.io | bash`



On windows, the "conda" command might not always work! Therefore, installation on hpc might be required.
This command is used to download nextflow on the hpc!
